### PORTAL-DOORS Project PDP-DREAM Repository for C# Software

This PDP-DREAM open source software project requires

The Telerik package, named and versioned Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Core.2021.2.616.nupkg, 
is required for developers to build and compile the PDP-DREAM software source code.
It is available to developers with a free trial license.
