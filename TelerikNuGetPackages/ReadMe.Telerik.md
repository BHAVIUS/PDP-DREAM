# PDP-DREAM Software

### PORTAL-DOORS Project - public PDP-DREAM Repository for C# Software

  This public PDP-DREAM repository software project requires a user interface widget package available from https://www.telerik.com/ called the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Components. 
  See https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-core-ui for more information about this Telerik nuget package.  

  The Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Core nuget package is required for developers to build and compile the PDP-DREAM software source code.
  It is available to developers with a free trial license from Telerik. It is available to students with a free license when applying with a student email address from a school in USA, UK, Australia or Bulgaria.
  See https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/devcraft/student-license for more information about the free license for students.
